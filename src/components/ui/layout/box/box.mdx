# Box

The Box component differs from other containers available in Material UI in that its usage is intended to be
  multipurpose and open-ended, just like a `<div>`. Components like Container, Stack and Paper, by contrast, feature
  usage-specific props that make them ideal for certain use cases: Container for main layout orientation, Stack for
  one-dimensional layouts, and Paper for elevated surfaces.
